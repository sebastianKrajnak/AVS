# AVS
Projects for Computation Systems Architecture class at VUT FIT Brno. I didn't setup readmes while I had this class and at this point I don't remember nor have the time to dig through the code to know what exactly we did. I think the first one was calculating the Mandelbroth set and plotting it out and the second one was displaying a bunny using Marching cubes or smth like that. Both have the PDFs with assignments there so just read those if you need to come back to it
